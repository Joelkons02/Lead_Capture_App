### Step 4: Flask Application Configuration

1. **Create Configuration File**:
   - Create a file named `config.py` in your project directory.

2. **Database Configuration**:
   - In `config.py`, add the configuration for connecting to the MySQL database. You'll need to specify the database URL, which includes the username, password, host, port, and database name.
   - Here's an example configuration:
     ```python
     import os

     class Config:
         SECRET_KEY = 'your_secret_key'  # Replace with a random secret key

         # MySQL database configuration
         SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'mysql+mysqlconnector://app_user:your_password@localhost/lead_capture_db'
         SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = False
     ```
   - Replace `'your_secret_key'`, `'app_user'`, `'your_password'`, and `'lead_capture_db'` with appropriate values.

### Step 5: Database Model Definition

1. **Create Models File**:
   - Inside the `app` directory, create a file named `models.py`.

2. **Define SQLAlchemy Model**:
   - In `models.py`, define the SQLAlchemy model for storing lead information.
   - Here's a basic example model:
     ```python
     from app import db

     class Lead(db.Model):
         id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
         email = db.Column(db.String(120), unique=True, nullable=False)
         name = db.Column(db.String(100))
         company = db.Column(db.String(100))

         def __repr__(self):
             return f'<Lead {self.email}>'
     ```
   - This model represents a lead with an email address, name, and company. You can customize it according to your requirements.

With these steps completed, your Flask application is configured to connect to the MySQL database, and you have defined the database model for storing lead information.

Next, we'll proceed with setting up the Flask routes and views to serve the landing page and handle form submissions. Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like to proceed to the next step!
